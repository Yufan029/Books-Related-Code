1. Design Principle
  - Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

2. Wrapper
  - Think of decorator objects as "wrapper"

3. The Decorator Pattern
  - attaches additional responsibilites to an object dynamically.
  - Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
